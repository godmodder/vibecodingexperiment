# vibecodingexperiment

Example utilities for experimenting with a three.js scene graph stored in Yjs.

## Examples

### Merge demo

```
npm install
node examples/merge-demo.js
```

### Browser editor

Bundle the editor and open the HTML file in a browser:

```
npm install
npm run build:editor
# then open examples/editor.html in a browser
```

Use the arrow keys to move the cube; its position is persisted in a Yjs document.
